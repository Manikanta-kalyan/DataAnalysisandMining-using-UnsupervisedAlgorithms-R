# DataAnalysisandMiningWithUnsupervisedAlgorithms-R

## Purpose
As part of the data Mining course I have analysed different datasets and implemented several Unsupervisied Learning algorithms using R 
<br>
<br>
The Algorithms include
<br>
* Market basket analysis
* Generalized association rules
* Recommender systems
* Hierarchical and prototype-based clustering
* Self-organizing maps
* Model selection
* Factor analysis
* Data visualization
* Probabilistic graphical models
* Bayesian Networks
* Gaussian Graphical Models
